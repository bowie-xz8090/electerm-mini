# Contributing (electerm-mini)

Thanks for considering a contribution to **electerm-mini**.

This repo is a trimmed fork of [electerm](https://github.com/electerm/electerm) focused on **SSH / SFTP / AI Smart Shell / themes**.

## Scope

Please keep changes aligned with Mini goals:

- Prefer SSH / SFTP / AI / theme / sync / settings improvements
- Avoid re-introducing Telnet / Serial / RDP / VNC / Spice / FTP session UIs unless there is an explicit product decision
- Respect `MINI_MODE` in `src/client/common/mini-features.js` and pack slim helpers under `build/bin/mini-slim.js`

For features that belong in the **full** electerm client, contribute upstream instead:

https://github.com/electerm/electerm
